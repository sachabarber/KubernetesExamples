# KubernetesExamples
This repo contains the source code/docker files/kubernetes files for the series of blogs that I have written on using KubernetesExamples



I will be walking through how do do the following things with Kubernetes


- [What is Kubernetes / Installing Minikube](https://sachabarbs.wordpress.com/2018/01/31/kubernetes-installing-minikube-part-1-of-n/)
- [What are pods/labels, declaring your first pod / Installing Minikube](https://sachabarbs.wordpress.com/2018/02/19/kubernetes-part-2-of-n-creating-our-first-pod/)
- [Services](https://sachabarbs.wordpress.com/2018/03/05/kubernetes-part-3-of-n-services/)
- [Singletons (such as a DB)](https://sachabarbs.wordpress.com/2018/03/19/kubernetes-part-4-of-n-singletons/)
- [ConfigMaps/Secrets](https://sachabarbs.wordpress.com/2018/04/09/kubernetes-part-5-of-n-config-maps-and-secrets/)
- [LivenessProbes/ReadinessProbes/Scaling Deployments](https://sachabarbs.wordpress.com/2018/04/10/kubernetes-part-6-of-n-health-checks-readiness-probes-scaling-deployments/)


The best bet is to read the blog post then find the section of the repo that goes with it, then follow along
