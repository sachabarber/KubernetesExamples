# KubernetesExamples
This repo contains the source code/docker files/kubernetes files for the series of blogs that I have written on using KubernetesExamples



I will be walking through how do do the following things with Kubernetes


- [What is Kubernetes / Installing Minikube](https://sachabarbs.wordpress.com/2018/01/31/kubernetes-installing-minikube-part-1-of-n/)
- What are pods/labels, declaring your first pod
- ConfigMaps/Secrets
- Services
- Singletons (such as a DB)
- Deployments/Replication Sets/Health Checks

The best bet is to read the blog post then find the section of the repo that goes with it, then follow along
